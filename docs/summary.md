Youâ€™ve learned how to build a real-time data pipeline with Apache Flink-based streaming SQL jobs and existing Flink source / sink connectors for Postgres / OpenSearch respectively. You also experienced how to extend the standard capabilities of Flink SQL by working with user-defined functions (UDFs) to interact with a pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT language model for sentiment analysis.
